# Data and third-party notices

## Eclipse validation references

Shadowline performs its own calculations from provider ephemerides. A compact
set of test expectations is derived from NASA GSFC eclipse predictions
published by Fred Espenak:

- WGS 84 path table for the total solar eclipse of 12 August 2026  
  `https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEpath/SEpath2001/SE2026Aug12Tpath.html`
- MapLibre local-circumstances calculator for the total solar eclipse of
  12 August 2026
  `https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsearch/SEsearchmap.php?Ecl=20260812`
- WGS 84 path table and Besselian elements for the total solar eclipse of
  30 June 1973:
  `https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEpath/SEpath1951/SE1973Jun30Tpath.html`

Shadowline's geometry and GIS APIs are independent of Astronomy Engine. If
portions of its algorithms are adapted into a future native provider, the
original copyright and MIT notice will be preserved with the derived source.

## OpenStreetMap

The planning application requests standard raster map tiles from
`tile.openstreetmap.org` for the user's current viewport. Map data is
copyright OpenStreetMap contributors and is available under the Open Data
Commons Open Database License. The application displays the required
attribution on the map and does not prefetch or redistribute the tiles.

The standard tile service is subject to the OpenStreetMap Foundation's tile
usage policy:
`https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/`

## NASA GIBS and Blue Marble

The fixed equirectangular view requests the
`BlueMarble_ShadedRelief_Bathymetry` layer from NASA's Global Imagery Browse
Services cacheable geographic WMTS endpoint:
`https://gibs.earthdata.nasa.gov/wmts/epsg4326/best/BlueMarble_ShadedRelief_Bathymetry/`.

The application displays NASA GIBS attribution with the map. Imagery is loaded
only for the visible fixed whole-Earth viewport and is not redistributed by
this repository. GIBS documentation is available at
`https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/gibs`.

We acknowledge the use of imagery provided by services from NASA's Global
Imagery Browse Services (GIBS), part of NASA's Earth Observing System Data and
Information System (EOSDIS).

## Mapterhorn and Copernicus GLO-30

The eclipse tracker may request a single runtime terrain sample from
Mapterhorn's public global zoom 3-12 Terrarium WebP endpoint when an observing
location has no supplied elevation:
